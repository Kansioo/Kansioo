Some of my recent projects:
- [Indium](https://github.com/ZonixUSNetwork/Indium) - a plugin which includes features such as staff chat, requests and reports.
- [CTF](https://github.com/ZonixUSNetwork/CTF) - a capture the flag plugin. This plugin is a bit incomplete, but does have most of the core gameplay features such as flag capturing and kits.
